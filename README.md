# CodeClauseInternship_Object_Detection_System
Project Details

Aim - Develop a system that can detect and classify objects in images or video streams.

Description - Create an object detection model capable of identifying and locating multiple
objects within an image or video. Utilize a pre-trained model such as YOLO (You Only
Look Once) or Faster R-CNN, and customize it to detect specific objects of interest.

Technologies - Python, TensorFlow or PyTorch, OpenCV

What I Learnt - Object detection algorithms, model integration, real-time image processing.
